Subject: Re: Google Developer Verification - Privacy Policy Update for Project 215414001403

Dear Google Developer Verification Team,

Thank you for your review of our project 215414001403 (The Wild Studio - khanhtran-prod). We have updated our privacy policy to address the data sharing disclosure requirements you identified.

**Privacy Policy Updates Made:**

We have added a comprehensive "Data Sharing and Disclosure" section that clearly states:

1. **Google OAuth Integration:**
   - We collect only Google user ID, name, and email address for authentication
   - This data is used solely for authentication and account access
   - Google user data is never shared with third parties for advertising purposes
   - We do not sell or share Google user data with data brokers or marketing companies

2. **Service Provider Sharing:**
   - We work with trusted providers (Stripe, AWS, Google Cloud, Mailchimp, SendGrid, Vercel)
   - Each provider has access only to information necessary for their services
   - All providers are contractually obligated to protect user data

3. **Legal and Business Requirements:**
   - We only disclose information when required by law, court order, or government request
   - Data may be shared in business transfers (mergers, acquisitions)
   - We disclose information to protect our rights, property, or safety

4. **No Data Selling:**
   - We explicitly state that we do not sell, rent, or trade personal information
   - We do not share user data for advertising or marketing purposes

**Updated Privacy Policy:**
Our comprehensive privacy policy is now available at:
https://thewildstudio.org/privacy

The policy includes detailed sections on:
- Photography rights and usage
- Google OAuth data handling
- Service provider disclosures
- Data security measures
- User rights and choices
- Children's privacy protection
- International data transfers

**Next Steps:**
We have resubmitted our application in Google Cloud Console with the updated privacy policy link. Please review our updated privacy policy and let us know if any additional information is needed.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We are committed to protecting our users' privacy and maintaining full compliance with Google's requirements.

Best regards,
